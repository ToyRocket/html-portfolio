<h1>The Best Movies According to Seanjamin (my highschool nickname but not in fact my real name)</h1>
<h2>|| Some of My All-Time Movie Favorite's ||</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Fast and The Furious 1</h3>
<p>
Rest in peace Paul Walker, this is a 
great franchise in my honest opinion. 
Paul helped make this an exciting journey for 
all included. What a spectacular movie  A+
</p>

<h3>Limitless</h3>
<p>
This film taught many to think 
outside the normal scope of reality box. 
I enjoyed going deep with cooper productions! When handed the option, red pill or blue pill?

<h3>The Little Mermaid OG</h3>
<p>
This movie not only foretold great stories and 
exciting tales, but provided 
Disney, one of the greatest movie albums and 
soundtracks of all time!
No contest, nothing less than a
Great Production!

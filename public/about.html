  Hi everyone, My name is Sean with an S. It's a pleasure to meet you! I grew up an adventurous kid from Georgia, 
  Roswell to be exact. My family is originally from New Orleans, Louisianna (Great food, great atmosphere 
  most definitely!). I love Georgia also, there is a lot of great nature and woods type regions to explore. 
  Theres a lot to do and it's a relatively safe area. I love playing games, video and board games. 
  I never understood why they arent spelled b-o-r-e-d games, instead b-o-a-r-d. But anyways, Pleasure to meet you!
  Sincerely, Sean..................................................................................................................

  Fun Fact: One of my favorite video games is Super Mario Bros.
  I'm inspired by the fun nature of the game series, one we all love and appreciate so much!
  The cheerful colors and competitive challenges create
  the environment to be desirable by all gamers and game fans
  around the world. Fighting games have also been an addiction for me,
  what a fun addiction! From Mortal Kombat to Tekken, years of my life
  have been consumed in games. What can I say, Game On! ................................................................................

  Whatever game/s you decide to 
  play whether it be the game of life or your 
  favorite video game, just remember to have fun and don't take things too seriously! Take care everyone.<hr />
